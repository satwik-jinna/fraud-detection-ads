# Ad Fraud Detection Demo

## Overview

This project demonstrates scalable and explainable methods to detect and visualize ad click fraud and ad spam, inspired by Google Trust & Safety Ad Traffic Quality analyst workflows.

It includes:
- **Bot & anomaly detection:** Python and SQL-based approaches to flag high-risk users, suspicious IPs, and bursty click activity.
- **Automated pipeline:** Production-ready DAG using Apache Airflow.
- **Visualization:** Maps and dashboards showing where fraud happens, and actionable reporting for stakeholders.
- **Geolocation:** Real-world mapping using GeoLite2 Country database.
